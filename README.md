Now that we know how to style our README, let’s look at what it should include. README files need to be descriptive to allow anyone to understand our project, the contents of our repository, and how to use it. It is the first file a person will see, and as a data professional, it is a crucial skill to communicate a project to others. Consider it to be the instruction manual for our repository.

Some essential items are the project title, a description of the technology used and why, a description of the process used to answer the question and why, and a table of contents.

Other characteristics of a good README are if it includes details of how the project came about and the motivation behind it, any limitations or challenges encountered, a recap of the problem it intends to solve, and what its intended use is. If we are sourcing information from elsewhere, it’s also essential to include the necessary credits.
